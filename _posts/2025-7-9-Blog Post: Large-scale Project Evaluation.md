title: Large-scale Project Evaluation
---
For this lab, I looked into a larger open-source project called p5.js. The main purpose of p5.js is to make creative coding accessible to everyone, especially people who might not come from a traditional coding background. It’s built with artists, designers, educators, and beginners in mind, and it lets users create visuals, animations, and interactive content easily using JavaScript. It’s basically a tool that helps people bring creative ideas to life through code.

I found out that over 450 people have contributed to p5.js so far. That’s a huge difference compared to the smaller project I wrote about before, OpenSSF Scorecard, which had around 170 contributors. p5.js has a big, active community and is used all over the world, especially in classrooms, art projects, and interactive websites.

The project is very active, with people regularly submitting pull requests, reporting issues, and discussing ideas. There are new updates and improvements happening all the time. It’s clear that the community behind p5.js really cares about keeping the project alive and making it better.

If I wanted to help with p5.js, I would start by learning how to use the library to make simple sketches and interactive art. The official website has a lot of tutorials and examples, so I would use those to practice. Once I get comfortable, I’d look at open issues on GitHub, maybe starting with beginner-friendly tags like "good first issue" to see how I could contribute.

p5.js has tons of technical documents that explain everything. There’s a full reference guide, tutorials, an online editor, and even videos to help people learn. They also have documents about how to contribute to the project, how to set up the development environment, and how to write documentation. This makes it really approachable, especially for someone like me who’s still learning.

Bugs and feature requests are tracked through GitHub issues and pull requests, just like with Scorecard. There are lots of open items, but they’re actively being worked on. The community seems very responsive, and many issues are clearly being addressed over time.

After reading the installation guide, I think it wouldn’t take long to download and start using p5.js. It’s designed to be easy to install—you can even just run it in a browser without downloading anything. For deeper development work, installing the project locally seems pretty straightforward too.

The developers mainly communicate through GitHub Discussions, issue comments, and community forums. There’s also a friendly online community where people share their art and projects, which I thought was really cool.

The most interesting thing I learned through this exercise is how technology and art can come together in creative coding. p5.js isn’t just for hardcore programmers—it’s for anyone with ideas who wants to express them visually using technology.

Comparing this to the smaller project I wrote about before, p5.js feels more creative and fun, while OpenSSF Scorecard is more technical and focused on security. Honestly, I would rather contribute to p5.js because I like the idea of making things that people can see and interact with, and the welcoming community makes it less intimidating for someone still learning like me.
