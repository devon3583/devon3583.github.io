title: The Greying of Open Source
---

After watching Abby Cabunoc Mayes' talk about open source, I felt like a lot of what she said really lined up with what I’ve been experiencing so far. She talked about how open source isn’t just about code it’s about people, community, and making an impact. That felt real to me.

Since joining the Contributor Catalyst program, I’ve seen how welcoming and supportive the open source space can be. You don’t have to be some expert coder to jump in. You just have to be willing to learn and try. I appreciated how Abby pointed out the need to make things more accessible and clear for beginners. That’s something I’ve definitely benefited from.

My Gen Z Take 

As a Gen Z student getting into tech, I feel like a lot of us want more than just a job we want to do work that matters. Open source gives us a chance to build stuff that actually helps people, and I think that’s what makes it so powerful. You’re not just doing things for a grade or a resume you’re solving real problems in real time.

But I also know that open source can still feel intimidating if you don’t know where to start or if you don’t see people like you involved. That’s where we can still grow as a community.

What Would Bring More Gen Z Folks In? 

Make it more visible – If we saw more open source content on the platforms we actually use (TikTok, YouTube, etc.), more people would check it out.

Show it’s not just for coders – There’s space in open source for designers, writers, educators, and people who just want to help.

More beginner-friendly projects – Things like Contributor Catalyst are a great way to learn. Having more entry points like that makes a big difference.

Create community – Gen Z is big on connection. If a project feels welcoming and social, we’re way more likely to stay involved.

Overall, Abby’s talk really reminded me why I joined this program in the first place to learn, grow, and hopefully make a difference. And I’m excited to keep doing just that.
