title: Small-scale Project Evaluation 
---

In this lab, I explored an open-source project called OpenSSF Scorecard. The main purpose of this project is to help evaluate the security of other open-source projects. Scorecard assigns security scores based on a series of automated checks, allowing users and maintainers to see how secure or risky a project might be. This tool is useful for developers, security teams, and anyone working with open-source software who wants to make informed decisions about the security of the tools they use or contribute to.

I found that 170 people have contributed to this project overall. While this is smaller compared to massive open-source communities like Linux or Kubernetes, it’s still a solid number of contributors for a security-focused tool. The project is active but not extremely high-traffic. There is steady work being done, but since it’s a more specialized tool, the level of daily contributions is less intense.

If I were interested in helping with OpenSSF Scorecard, I would start by installing the Scorecard tool and using it on small projects to understand how it works. This hands-on practice would help me get comfortable with its features. I would also look for any bugs, usability issues, or ideas for new security checks that could improve the tool.

The project has a strong set of technical documents that are helpful for both users and contributors. Some key resources include the README.md, which covers installation, usage examples, and an overview of the project. There’s also docs/checks.md, which explains each security check in detail, and docs/ossf-scorecard-onboarding.md for new contributors. Additional documents like the risk level guide, probe explanations, Scorecard REST API documentation, and even an academic paper provide deep technical insights for anyone looking to contribute or understand the tool more thoroughly.

Bugs and feature requests are tracked mainly through GitHub issues and pull requests. Currently, there are 16 pull requests waiting for review and around 335 open issues. This shows that while there is an active effort to maintain and improve the project, there’s also a significant backlog—something not unusual for open-source projects. Many issues are being addressed, showing that maintainers and contributors are engaged in keeping the project moving forward.

After reading through the installation guide in the README, I believe it wouldn’t take me long to download and install Scorecard. The instructions are clear, straightforward, and even include pictures, which makes it very beginner-friendly.

The developers mainly communicate using GitHub Discussions, which allows them to share ideas, ask questions, and collaborate on new features or bug fixes. This open communication style fits well with the open-source model.

The most interesting thing I learned through this exercise is how open-source security tools like Scorecard play a key role in keeping other open-source projects safe. I also realized how welcoming and well-documented some open-source projects are, which makes it easier for newcomers like me to get involved.
