# Checking In on My Summer Goal: Improving My Communication üó£Ô∏è

Earlier this summer, I set a personal goal to work on improving my communication, specifically becoming more confident in expressing my ideas, asking questions, and staying engaged in group discussions. I chose this goal because I know that in tech (and really in any career), strong communication makes a huge difference, especially when working on teams or contributing to open source projects.

## What progress have I made so far?

So far, I‚Äôve definitely seen some growth. During our project work, I‚Äôve been making a real effort to speak up more and share my thoughts, even when I‚Äôm unsure. I‚Äôve also gotten better at asking for clarification instead of just staying silent when I don‚Äôt fully understand something. Talking through problems with my team, explaining pull requests, and participating in group reflections have all helped me practice being clear and direct.

I also noticed that writing blog posts like this one is helping me organize my thoughts better and reflect on my progress. That‚Äôs something I didn‚Äôt expect, but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs part of the program.

## What can I do between now and the end of the program to keep working on it?

Between now and the end of the program, I want to keep pushing myself to participate more in group conversations, especially during team check-ins and discussions. I also want to challenge myself to ask at least one thoughtful question during every session, whether it‚Äôs about a project, a tool, or someone‚Äôs experience in open source.

I‚Äôm also planning to go back and look at a few past GitHub issues and pull requests, both mine and others‚Äô, to see how people explain their changes. I think studying good communication in action can help me improve how I write and talk about technical work.

## What can Emily, Silas, or Samir do to support me?

Honestly, you all have already been super helpful and encouraging, but one thing that would help me keep growing is direct feedback. If you notice moments where I explain something well or where I could be clearer, I‚Äôd appreciate the heads-up. Even just small pointers would help me keep learning and improving.

Also, if there are any future sessions or breakout opportunities where I could lead a discussion or present something, I‚Äôd be down to step up and try it. It would be a great way to keep practicing.

Thanks again for all the support so far. It‚Äôs been a great space to grow.
