Hi, my name is Devon Bobo. I’m from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and I’m a computer science major with a concentration in cybersecurity at Southern University and A&M College. I’m currently expecting to graduate in May 2027.

I don’t have prior experience with open source projects yet, but I’ve worked on technical projects like a weather balloon simulation in C++, and I recently competed in a cybersecurity Capture the Flag challenge hosted by SANS, which gave me a strong foundation in problem solving and real-world security tasks.

One of the strongest characteristics I bring to a team is my problem solving ability, which I've developed through programming coursework and hands-on cybersecurity training. I also value communication and collaboration, both of which I’ve practiced through team-based projects and seminars.

This summer, I’d like to improve my resourcefulness—learning how to better navigate open source documentation, new tools, and unfamiliar codebases. To do this, I plan to stay curious, ask thoughtful questions, and embrace a growth mindset by treating every challenge as an opportunity to learn. I would love to connect with with you on [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/devonbobo)
