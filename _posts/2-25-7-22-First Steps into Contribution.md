# Getting Started with OpenSSF: First Fix and Pull Request 

This week, my team and I started digging into the OpenSSF Scorecard project. At first, we spent some time just getting familiar with the repo and looking through the issues to find ones that matched our interests and skill level. After going through a few, we found some that looked like good potential fits.

While searching, we came across an issue that had been started by students from a previous round of the Contributor Catalyst program but wasn‚Äôt finished. We decided to pick it up, figured out what needed to be done, made the fix, and submitted a pull request to close it out. That felt like a solid win for our first real contribution to the project!

Now that we‚Äôve gotten a better feel for the repo and the contribution process, I think the next good step would be working on an issue that involves the Scorecard checks logic. It seems a little more technical, but it would be a good challenge to help us keep learning and push ourselves a bit more.

## What‚Äôs Next? üîç

Now that we‚Äôve gotten a better feel for the repo and the contribution process, I think the next good step would be working on an issue that involves the **Scorecard checks logic**. It seems a little more technical, but it would be a good challenge to help us keep learning and push ourselves a bit more.

Looking forward to diving deeper into the project and continuing to grow as a contributor!
