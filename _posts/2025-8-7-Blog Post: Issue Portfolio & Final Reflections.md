At the start of this program, I set a personal goal to improve my communication skills. I wanted to get better at speaking up in group settings, asking questions when I needed help, and clearly explaining what I was working on. I knew that being able to communicate well would help me not just in this program, but in anything I do in tech.

Looking back, I can say I’ve definitely made progress. I started out kind of hesitant like I didn’t want to say the wrong thing or ask a “dumb” question. But over time, I got more comfortable sharing updates during check ins, asking for clarification when I was confused, and just being more active in conversations. The more I did it, the easier it got. Writing these blog posts actually helped too. It made me slow down and think about how I was explaining things. I still have room to grow, but this program helped me take that first big step. I think what helped most was being in a space where it was okay to not know everything. Everyone here wanted to help each other, and that made it easier to speak up.

This summer, my team and I worked on a few issues in the OpenSSF Scorecard project. I worked mostly with Kailea and Kaylee. We started by looking through beginner friendly issues. One of the first ones we found was something that a previous group had started but didn’t finish. We took over that issue, figured out what still needed to be done, fixed it, and submitted a pull request. That was our first real contribution and it felt good to be able to finish something someone else started. After that, we looked into some more technical issues related to how the checks are written in the Scorecard. Some of those are still open and waiting on feedback, but we learned a lot by exploring the code and trying to understand how everything works.

The most challenging issue was one where we had to dig into the check logic. It was tough at first because we didn’t know exactly where to look or how things were connected. But we asked questions, leaned on each other, and took our time breaking things down.
The most rewarding issue was definitely that first one we closed out. It felt like we were really part of the open source process picking up where someone left off and helping get it over the finish line. That was a cool moment.

Overall, this program taught me a lot. I learned how to navigate real GitHub repos, contribute to open source, and work with a team in a remote setting. But the most important thing I gained was confidence. I used to think open source was only for people who already knew everything. Now I know that it’s about showing up, being willing to learn, and taking that first step. You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to start.

I do feel like I’m ready to keep contributing to open source after this. I know how to find good first issues, how to follow contribution guides, and how to communicate with maintainers. I still want to get better at working with more complex codebases, but I feel like I know how to approach that now.
I definitely want to stay involved. I’m especially interested in projects that connect with cybersecurity or that help kids in underrepresented communities get access to tech and STEM. That’s something I care a lot about, and I’d love to contribute to projects that support that mission. I plan to keep exploring GitHub, stay active in Scorecard when I can, and maybe even find a new project to join.
