title: My Motivation 
---
One challenge I want to impact with technology in my lifetime is helping make STEM programs more accessible for kids in small communities or who attend small schools. Growing up, I saw firsthand how limited resources and opportunities in some areas can prevent talented and curious students from exploring fields like computer science, cybersecurity, and engineering. I believe that with the right tools, outreach, and technology, we can break down these barriers and open new doors for the next generation.

When I am successful in making this dream a reality, the first person I want to tell is my mother. She has always been my biggest supporter, encouraging me to pursue my goals no matter how big they seem. Sharing this success with her would mean everything to me.

Right now, I haven’t found any open source projects directly related to this area of interest yet. However, I’m excited to start looking into projects that focus on education technology (EdTech), open-source learning platforms, or coding tools for beginners. Based on what I’ve learned so far, these kinds of projects could be great candidates for me to contribute to in the future as I build my skills and knowledge.

I look forward to continuing this journey and finding ways to use technology to inspire and empower young minds everywhere.
